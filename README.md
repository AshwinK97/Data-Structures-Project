# Word-Dictionary
This repository contains files for the Data structures final project - Word Dictionary.

For our dictionary, we implemented a hash table with our own custom hashing algorithm and dynamically resizable array. We also designed a command line interface to operate our dictionary with.

In order to run the tests specified in 'exercises.txt', type 'test' in the CLI. In order to create a custom dictionary to run your own commands on, type 'new' in the CLI.

For a list of available commands, type 'help' in the CLI.
